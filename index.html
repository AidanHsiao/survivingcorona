		<p class="title">Budgeting during the coronavirus</p>
		<p>The coronavirus is (not so slowly) taking over the world. With the United States now number one in coronavirus cases, tensions are high for people to find a solution. However, for the people who aren't exactly lucky enoguh to make it through an emergency, much less a global pandemic, this coronavirus means something much more than just risk of disease; it directly affects everyone, even if they are compeletely anti-social, and that is due to the closure of basic jobs. For example, in Texas, unemployment has skyrocketed, being multiplied by 9 times. Everywhere is feeling the pinch. However, we should not lose hope yet. A bill is currently going through Congress that would allow the officially unemployed (due to the coronavirus) to be paid $1200 a month, similar to Universal Basic Income but only for those who are struck hard by the coronavirus. Of course, this is bare minimum (so nothing we take for granted can be bought), but that way, more people will be allowed to have this form of UBI. In my opinion (excluding rent of course, San Francisco rent is hell), 1200 is not that much. This makes $40 a day for food (your old college days are saying hello), insurance, transportation, electric/water bill, and more minute costs that I did not mention. Here's how I would spend $1200 (keep in mind I have 60 a month for allowance and I think that's a lot).</p>

      <h2>Food</h2>
      <div style="margin:10px 20px;text-align:justify">Food is absolutely the most important item on this list. I believe that making $50 weekly grocery trips is something that I would do, as I have to transport myself everywhere (as I don't have a car). Farmers and food manufacturers, I would imagine, are making quite the bank right now. That drops it down to $1000/month. (I can eat less. Cup noodle time)</div>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Insurance (Mainly Health)</h2>
      <div style="margin:10px 20px;text-align:justify">Insurance is another major necessity, because the American healthcare system is, for lack of better word, fucked. Insurance companies have successfully convinced hospitals to jack up prices in order to market their insurance to consumers.  Because of this, insurance is near necessary (it costs $600 per month here). That makes it now $400/month.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Clothing</h2>
      <div style="margin:10px 20px;text-align:justify">Psssh. Laundry detergent and things like that are stuff we take for granted. If your house has water (assuming it does), simply wash the clothing with tap water and hang it outside. If it doesn't, find a local source of FRESH water (do you want your clothes to smell like dead seaweed?) and wash there. This should be fine if you have clothes already. No cost taken off.</div>

      <h2>Electric/Water/Wifi Bill</h2>
      <div style="margin:10px 20px;text-align:justify">These are also extremely important because all of these are life-changing for obvious reasons. The easiest thing that you can do to save money on this is simply move in with other people to reduce the total cost. However, since I live in a house that's HOA managed, the cost of HOA covers it, but HOA still comes with a base cost of $200/month. Down to $200/month.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Cell Phone (SIM Card)</h2>
      <div style="margin:10px 20px;text-align:justify">This one, on second thought, is relatively important. A phone call can do wonders to help, but other than that, I can see no practical use of a SIM Card (assuming you also paid the wifi bill like I mentioned earlier). Unless you're in a contract, cancel this if you need to. The use of wifi already really supports your connection to the online world. No cost off.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Transportation</h2>
      <div style="margin:10px 20px;text-align:justify">Assuming I'm living the hermit life (which I basically already am), transportation shouldn't be an issue. Since I don't have a car, the only time I will be going around is to go to safeway to make grocery trips. Since a round trip is $2 (for SamTrans), and assuming an extra $2 a month for whatever, I'm making this $10 a month, leaving me with $190 a month.</div>
