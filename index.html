		<p class="title">Budgeting during the coronavirus</p>
		<p>The coronavirus is (not so slowly) taking over the world. With the United States now number one in coronavirus cases, tensions are high for people to find a solution. However, for the people who aren't exactly lucky enoguh to make it through an emergency, much less a global pandemic, this coronavirus means something much more than just risk of disease; it directly affects everyone, even if they are compeletely anti-social, and that is due to the closure of basic jobs. For example, in Texas, unemployment has skyrocketed, being multiplied by 9 times. Everywhere is feeling the pinch. However, we should not lose hope yet. A bill is currently going through Congress that would allow the officially unemployed (due to the coronavirus) to be paid $1200 a month, similar to Universal Basic Income but only for those who are struck hard by the coronavirus. Of course, this is bare minimum (so nothing we take for granted can be bought), but that way, more people will be allowed to have this form of UBI. In my opinion (excluding rent of course, San Francisco rent is hell), 1200 is not that much. This makes $40 a day for food (your old college days are saying hello), insurance, transportation, electric/water bill, and more minute costs that I did not mention. Here's how I would spend $1200 (keep in mind I have 60 a month for allowance and I think that's a lot).</p>

    <div class="column">
      <h2>Food</h2>
      <div style="margin:10px 20px;text-align:justify">Food is absolutely the most important item on this list. I believe that making $50 weekly grocery trips is something that I would do, as I have to transport myself everywhere (as I don't have a car). Farmers and food manufacturers, I would imagine, are making quite the bank right now. That drops it down to $1000/month. (I can eat less. Cup noodle time)</div>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Insurance (Mainly Health)</h2>
      <div style="margin:10px 20px;text-align:justify">Insurance is another major necessity, because the American healthcare system is, for lack of better word, fucked. Insurance companies have successfully convinced hospitals to jack up prices in order to market their insurance to consumers.  Because of this, insurance is near necessary (it costs $600 per month here). That makes it now $400/month.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Clothing</h2>
      <div style="margin:10px 20px;text-align:justify">Psssh. Laundry detergent and things like that are stuff we take for granted. If your house has water (assuming it does), simply wash the clothing with tap water and hang it outside. If it doesn't, find a local source of FRESH water (do you want your clothes to smell like dead seaweed?) and wash there. This should be fine if you have clothes already. No cost taken off.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="column">
      <h2>Electric/Water/Wifi Bill</h2>
      <div style="margin:10px 20px;text-align:justify">These are also extremely important because all of these are life-changing for obvious reasons. The easiest thing that you can do to save money on this is simply move in with other people to reduce the total cost. However, since I live in a house that's HOA managed, the cost of HOA covers it, but HOA still comes with a base cost of $200/month. Down to $200/month.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Cell Phone (SIM Card)</h2>
      <div style="margin:10px 20px;text-align:justify">This one, on second thought, is relatively important. A phone call can do wonders to help, but other than that, I can see no practical use of a SIM Card (assuming you also paid the wifi bill like I mentioned earlier). Unless you're in a contract, cancel this if you need to. The use of wifi already really supports your connection to the online world. No cost off.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Transportation</h2>
      <div style="margin:10px 20px;text-align:justify">Assuming I'm living the hermit life (which I basically already am), transportation shouldn't be an issue. Since I don't have a car, the only time I will be going around is to go to safeway to make grocery trips. Since a round trip is $2 (for SamTrans), and assuming an extra $2 a month for whatever, I'm making this $10 a month, leaving me with $190 a month.</div>

		<p class="title">But what if you DID have a job before?</p><p>While the coronavirus was quite a surprise to everyone, it wasn't exactly unexpected. The United States typically goes through an economic crisis every ten years, so people were forecasting some kind of crisis, just not in this form. However, people have been trying their best to save up to wait to the next major crisis (now), and that strategy has paid off. Because of this, I'm going to try to use this strategy to protect myself against a crisis that will be happening in the 2030s, and for those my age, I'll be crunching to numbers to do so. Let's get started.</p><br>
		<div style="width:45%;float:left;margin-left:2%;margin-right:3%"><p>Assuming that the coronavirus goes away by the start of 2021, (which is a very very pessimistic attitude), and that I graduate college by 2026, I can get about 4 years worth of money before the next one hits. Luckily, my parents have promised to pay for college fees so long as I get into a good college, so no problem there. Assuming I'll have the job that I want (aerospace engineer, 114-167k), after 4 years I will have earned a base amount of 500k. Of course, now is when we start subtracting things. By using a payroll calculator I have found that earning 125k per year will get you around 36% tax deduction, so have to take that off. Of course, after this, we need to find the costs of necessities, such as food, insurance, gas, etc. I'll start with food costs, and rent, the two most important things in the post-college lifestyle. Of course, then there's transportation and insurance. I decided to just do a base cost of 1500 for other things that I most likely would have forgotten. Doing the math, I end up with around $2000 left at the end of the month that I can invest into savings. I will deposit this amount of money into savings while gaining interest each month. I made a program to do this because making a normal sigma equation wouldn't work here. Now I have the number of the right that says how much I will have, but how will that stand to another economic crisis? To find out, I simply took the cost of living each month (around 5000 a month in my case) and divided that from how much was in my savings, and I could survive 22 months without any sort of help before savings ran out, which is actually really nice. After doing some more ratio math, I found that for every month I work I can earn enough to not only feed myself but to sustain myself another half month just off of savings. Pretty epic if you ask me.</p></div>
